# Cryptocurrencies

The goal of this assignment was to prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means, reduce data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn, predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn, and create plots to visualize clusters for analysis. 

Through the analysis of the dataframes created, 5 clusters were identified in the 3D which is the same value identified in the elbow curve. A challenge in this model was to effectively format and eliminate features that were not necessary for the PCA to be applied, but still be able to combine them for data visibility in the model. 
One thing that could have been done is to learn how much information can be attributed to each principal component as that could contribute to how many features were included in the analysis. 

Finally, in the comparison with the coins mined vs. coins supplied, one detail that proved relevant to graphically determine what cryptocurrency shows as not only an outlier but also see the effect that these points could have had on the clustering models.
